# Myntra Clone

A Myntra clone built using **React.js** and **Redux** with proper state management. This project mimics the basic functionality of the Myntra e-commerce platform, including displaying products, adding items to the cart, managing the cart state, and more.

## Features

- **Product Listing**:
  - Display a list of products with images, descriptions, and prices.
- **Cart Management**:
  - Add, remove, and update the quantity of items in the cart.
  - View the total price and manage the cart state using Redux.
- **Product Filters**:
  - Filter products based on categories or price ranges (if applicable).
- **State Management**:
  - Efficient state handling with Redux to manage the appâ€™s global state (products, cart, etc.).

## Tech Stack

- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux**: State management to handle the application state globally.
- **CSS/SCSS**: Styling for the product cards, cart page, and overall layout.
